# Compositional Diffable Playground

My playground for trying stuff with compositional collection view layout and diffable data source.

Goal is to showcase different compositional layouts and how to achieve them. Feel free to use any code you can find and if you have interesting layout idea - open PR!

I plan to update README with concrete code samples once this example app grows a bit. For now it presents random color - I hope to have better sample data someday.
